# Aim of the project
In this project we propose two different methods in order to monitor road traffic using video sequences and computer vision algorithms. The aim of the project is the apply these techniques to detect possible anomalies on the road and prevent drivers to exceed the speed limit. Our first method consist on combining different video processing techniques as background modeling, stabilization, morphology and Kalman filters. The second method makes use of simple CNN's to predict speed.
